<h1 class="title">Privacy in a digital environment</h1>
<p>
This is the blog-post version of a talk held by Lisa and Til at the
railsgirls hackday last Dec 14th. It tries to be an <span class="underline">introduction</span> to
the topic - don't be offended if you find it is an oversimplification,
because it certainly is.
</p>


<div id="outline-container-sec-1" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-1">What is privacy and why does it even matter?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">
<p>
Privacy is a human right. It is the line that defines how far society
can intrude our personal lives. It developed over time from the
emergence of personal space and private property, and has become a
constituting element of our individuality. Nowadays personal data
defines us and our private lives, being able to decide how this data
is gathered and used is an important part of our civil rights.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-2" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-2">Defend yourself</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">
<p>
Anything you do to protect your privacy is better than doing nothing.
</p>

<p>
Security always changes gradually - it can always be improved, but
never perfect. The more you do, the harder and therefore more unlikely
it becomes for an adversary to violate your right for privacy. Yes you
will mistakes. The tools and concepts can be complicated and
intimidating, but considering that no security is the worst situation
at all, beginning to take small steps can only make it better for you.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-3" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-3">Technical defense</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">
<p>
If you communicate with someone else over the internet, then your data
travels through untrusted territory, where it could potentially be
read by others. The data goes through many intermediate stations
sitting between sender and recipient. The route it takes does not have
to make sense geographically - because it is just moving electrons,
the location of the intermediate stations does not matter that
much. Often when two people in germany communicate with each other,
even when they are in the same city, the data travels through multiple
stations in the US.
</p>

<p>
Practically all ways to defend against this are based on encryption:
to transform your data in such a way that only you and your
communication partner can make sense of it.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-3-1" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-3-1">How does this work?</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3-1">
<p>
All kinds of communication data, the text of an email, the audio of a
phone call or anything else, can be represented as sequence of
numbers. Encryption is an transformation that changes this sequence of
numbers, so it doesn't really matter what kind of data is being
encrypted.
</p>

<p>
The transformation could for example be something like: split a
sequence of numbers into chunks of 100 digits, and multiply each
by 17. The recipient then needs to divide each chunk by 17 to decipher
the message. Only you and the recipient know how to encrypt and
decrypt the data, so you must not tell anyone that you used the number
17 - it's a 'shared secret'.
</p>

<p>
Of course the algorithm in this example is hazardously simple and the
number 17 could easily be guessed by someone trying out a few
numbers. You should instead use well known technology which uses
better algorithms.
</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-4" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-4">Symmetric Encryption</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-4">
<p>
When the two communication partners both have a shared secret like in
the example above, then it is called symmetric encryption.
</p>

<p>
To start communicating using symmetric encryption, it is necessary
that you somehow exchange the shared secret privately, e.g. by meeting
in person. If you only know each other from the internet, then this is
not possible.
</p>

<p>
Thankfully, smart people have come up with techniques to do
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-5" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-5">Asymmetric Encryption</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-5">
<p>
Asymmetric encryption uses some crazy mathematics to provide you with
a so-called public / private key pair. The public key can only be used
to <span class="underline">encrypt</span>, the private key to <span class="underline">decrypt</span>. Therefore you can safely
give anyone a copy of the public key, e.g. email it to someone over
the internet, but you must keep your private key private, e.g. by
storing it on your computer's hard disk.
</p>

<p>
Here's an analogy:
</p>

<p>
Public key(s): <img src="lock.jpg" alt="lock.jpg" /> <img src="lock.jpg" alt="lock.jpg" /> <img src="lock.jpg" alt="lock.jpg" />
</p>

<p>
Private key: <img src="key.jpg" alt="key.jpg" />
</p>

<p>
The open locks can be copied and sent around freely. When someone
wants to send you a message, she protects the message by locking it
with one of the locks. The message is now encrypted, and can only be
unlocked by you who is the only person in possession of the private
key.
</p>

<p>
This principle is the basis for the following technologies.
</p>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-6" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-6">Email encryption with PGP</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-6">
<p>
PGP is the most common tool for encrypting emails. A good way to start
is to install the email program Thunderbird and a plugin for it called
Enigma. We recommend that you visit a cryptoparty or let a friend show
you how to set it up. While it's perfectly possible to learn it on
your own by reading tutorials, it's more fun and quicker with personal
advice.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-7" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-7">HTTPS</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-7">
<p>
You are already using it. Whenever you see a lock symbol in the
address bar of your browser, then the data that travels between your
browser and the web server is encrypted.
</p>

<p>
Whenever possible, prefer to access a website over https instead of
unencrypted http.
</p>

<p>
Even if the information on that web server is publicly available, the
fact that you are accessing it is part of your privacy and worth to be
protected. If you are transferring personal data to and from the web
server then of course even more so.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-8" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-8">Tor</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-8">
<p>
Tor is a very sophisticated technology that enables anonymous
browsing. It adds multiple layers of encryption on top of each other
and routes your traffic through multiple stations where each station
only knows about its next neighbours.
</p>

<p>
Despite being a complicated technology, it's quite easy to use by
installing a modified version of Firefox:
